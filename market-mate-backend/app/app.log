Alright, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking me to summarize the resume of Omkar Deepak based on the provided context.

First, I'll read through the context carefully. There are a few sections mentioned: LinkedIn profile, GitHub, email address, and the work experience. Then there's an academic section with two projects.

Looking at the work experience first. The user is employed at YETI Racing in Kochi, India since December 2024 until now. They worked as a web developer and designer, using Next.js for the website. They designed interfaces with Figma, collaborating with team members to align the aesthetics with branding. Styled the website using Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsiveness across all pages. Implemented a crowdfunding feature.

For academic projects, they built AI-based health diagnose for Jupyter and Hugging Face, trained the model, integrated NLP. Then ZUHI project used Hume API, Gemini, etc., answered admission-related questions, designed form generation system with React and Node.js, integrated OAuth and Firebase authentication.

Education details at Cochin University of Science and Technology, B.Tech in IT from June 2023 to May 2027. Worked on tracking funding progress, cross-device testing, ensured consistency across platforms.

Now, the user provided "EDUCATION" section but it's cut off. The rest is the academic projects and work experience. So the resume has these sections: LinkedIn, GitHub, email address, work experience, academic projects, education, etc., but not explicitly listed as a bullet point in the answer.

The context doesn't mention anything about academic scores or grades, so I can only summarize the given information up to education.
</think>

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question "what are the projects" using the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I see that there's a section about Work Experience, specifically YETI Racing with Kochi, India starting from December 2024 until present. There are details about their website development in Figma and Tailwind CSS, but since the question is about projects, maybe those don't apply here.

Next, under Academic Projects, there's a section for AI-based Health Diagnose. They built an AI model that can detect illnesses from user inputs. They used Jupyter and Hugging Face, which are tools often associated with machine learning. Then they integrated natural language processing, so I think this is another project in the context.

Then there's ZUHI – AI Powered Admission Assistant, where they developed a system to help students apply for college using Hume API and Gemini. They also used NLP and TTS for conversational AI, so that seems like another academic project.

Under Education, there'sNULL CLASS Remote Web Developer Intern from May 2024 to June 2024, working on building a job posting website. They used React for the frontend, Node.js Express for backend, and Firebase for authentication. That sounds like their technical project during an internship.

So, compiling all these, the projects are:
1. AI-based Health Diagnose
2. ZUHI – AI powered Admission Assistant
3. NULL CLASS Remote Web Development Intern
4. NullClass Job Posting Website

I should list each of these with a brief description so that the answer isn't in the context itself and follows the user's instructions.
</think>

Here are the projects listed under the provided context:

1. **AI-based Health Diagnose**: A system developed to detect basic illnesses using AI, employing Jupyter and Hugging Face for training and NLP for natural language processing.

2. **ZUHI – AI Powered Admission Assistant**: An AI-powered tool designed to streamline college admissions with features like Hume API integration and conversational AI support.

3. **NULL CLASSRemote Web Developer Intern**: A web development role during an internship, focusing on job posting generation using React, Node.js Express, and Firebase for authentication and user experience.

4. **NullClass Job Posting Website**: The technical project of a web developer intern working on building a website to post academic job opportunities.

Alright, I need to summarize the resume provided. Let me start by looking at each section of the context given.

First, there's the LinkedIn and GitHub links, which are probably part of the cover letter or portfolio but aren't directly in the resume itself. Then, under Work Experience, there's a YETI RACING position starting from December 2024. I see they used Next.js for the website and Tailwind CSS to style it. That seems like their technical skills.

Next is an academic project called AI-based Health Diagnose, which they implemented using Jupyter and Hugging Face. They trained a model using NLP, so that's a strong technical skill in AI and data science. Then there's ZUHI – AI Powered Admission Assistant, where they developed an AI system with Hume API and Gemini. This involved conversational AI and smart form generation, which shows their ability to build user-friendly tools.

Under Education, they have a B.Tech in IT from Cochin University of Science and Technology starting May 2023 to May 2027. Their thesis was on cross-device compatibility with null class, ensuring no loss in quality or performance. This is technical and shows their expertise in backend development and user experience.

Looking at the context, the only part that says "Answer:" seems out of place because it doesn't belong in a resume. So I should just list all the information given without using markdown.
</think>

OMKAR DEEPAK's resume includes:

- Work Experience:
  - YETI Racing (2024-Present): Developed an online presence, used Next.js and Tailwind CSS for styling, designed user interfaces with Figma, trained a health diagnose AI model.

- Academic Projects:
  - AI-based Health Diagnose: Implemented NLP models, developed conversational AI tools.
  - ZUHI – AI Powered Admission Assistant: Built a smart form generator using Hume API and TTS.

- Education:
  - B.Tech in IT (2023-2027): Worked on cross-device compatibility with null class.

I don't have information to summarize this into a single sentence.

Okay, so I'm trying to help answer this question about summarizing an resume. The context provided includes the person's LinkedIn profile, email, job experience, academic projects, and education details.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The user has given me a specific question: "Summarize the resume." So, they're probably looking for a summary of their resume on this platform or in some other context.

Looking at the context provided, it seems like there's more than one section—LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and then job experience, academic projects, and education. But since the user is asking about summarizing the resume, I should focus on that part. The context includes their LinkedIn profile but not a traditional resume itself.

Wait, maybe the "resume" here refers to an academic or professional summary? Let me check the context again. Oh, right! There's a job experience section where they describe their work as a web developer and designer for YETI Racing in Kochi, India. They created a website using Next.js, Figma, Tailwind CSS, Hugging Face, etc., implemented a crowdfunding feature.

So, to summarize the resume, I should take that detailed job experience summary and condense it into a brief overview, highlighting their key skills, projects, roles, and achievements. I'll need to make sure I include any relevant details from their academic background as well, but since the user didn't mention an academic section in their question, I might focus just on their professional experiences here.

I also notice that they're using platforms like LinkedIn for job experience, GitHub for code, email addresses, and Nullclass for a web development internship. Maybe these are extra info not directly related to the resume summary, but perhaps part of their full profile. But since the user specifically asked about summarizing the resume, I should stick to the professional section.

So, putting it all together, my response should be a concise overview that includes their work experience in developing a website with various frameworks and integrating crowdfunding features. That's the main summary they needed.
</think>

The resume summary provided highlights OMKAR DEEPAK's professional experience as a web developer and designer for YETI Racing, focusing on creating an appealing online presence. Their skills include using Next.js, Figma, Tailwind CSS, Hugging Face, and implementing a crowdfunding feature.

Okay, I need to summarize the resume provided. Let me look through all the sections.

First, LinkedIn, GitHub, email address, and social media are the contact information. That's straightforward, so that's about it.

Next, work experience starts with YETI RACING. They worked as a web developer and designer from December 2024 to present. So I should mention the company name clearly, maybe bolding it for emphasis in the summary.

They used Next.js for the website, which is awesome because I know Next.js is popular for frontend development. Tailwind CSS was implemented too, so that's a good point about styling and responsiveness. Figma was their design tool, and they styled each page with Tailwind. They also included a crowdfunding feature, which shows they're involved in community building.

Moving on to academic projects: AI-based health diagnosis using Jupyter and Hugging Face for NLP. That seems technical but important. Then ZUHI, another AI project integrating Hume API and Gemini for admissions. They used LLMs like GPT-4 or 3 for predictions. The smart form generator is a good one too.

Education: B. Tech in IT from COSTEC, Kochi, May 2023 to June 2027. Their backend was integrated with funding progress tracking, which shows attention to scale and performance. They ensured cross-device compatibility by testing thoroughly, which is a quality aspect. Cross-platform functionality is key for any tech career.

Web development experience at Nullclass from May 2024 to June 2024: using React and Node.js. They built a job posting website with reusable components and state management. Integration of OAuth and Firebase shows secure login methods, which are important nowadays.

So I need to condense all this into a summary without the details. Make sure each section is clear but brief.

Okay, so I need to summarize the resume of Omkar Deepak based on the provided context. Let me go through each section one by one.

First, the LinkedIn and GitHub links are straightforward—they're his social media profiles. Then there's a phone number he has listed. His work experience is split into two parts: YETI Racing as a web developer and Figma designer, with some specific tasks like designing interfaces and styling the website using Tailwind CSS. He also mentions implementing a crowdfunding feature, though that might be less detailed.

Next, his academic projects include AI-based health diagnosis and an AI-powered admission assistant project. In each of these, he built models using Jupyter and Hugging Face, implemented NLP for queries, and designed form generators.

His education is from Cochin University of Science and Technology with a B.Tech in Information Technology, starting June 2023 and ending May 2027. There's some cross-device compatibility testing mentioned but it's more about the job role than his resume content.

Now, summarizing this into a professional summary would include his experience across both work and academic projects, highlighting key achievements like designing user interfaces, building models, and developing forms. It should be concise yet informative, showing he has hands-on experience in web development, AI applications, and academic projects.
